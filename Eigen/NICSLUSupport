  * \defgroup NICSLUSupport_Module NICSLUSupport module
  *
  * This module provides an interface to the NICSLU library
  * It provides the following factorization class:
  * - class NICSLU: a sparse parallel LU factorization, well-suited for circuit simulation.
  *
  * \code
  * #include <Eigen/NICSLUSupport>
  * \endcode
  *
  * In order to use this module, the nicslu headers must be accessible from the include paths, and your binary must be linked to the nicslu library and its dependencies.
  * For a cmake based project, you can use our FindNICSLU.cmake module to help you in this task.
